### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a class assignment introducing me to Github

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Python, in addition to computer programming through Macomb community college, and Biochemistry through Arizona State.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything fun...pretty soon!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I have lots of stories, but not much knowledge about Python yet!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: doctorlynch@hotmail.com

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She It

âš¡ Fun fact: "been there, done that" is said often
